    "## Context-Enriched Retrieval in RAG\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances AI responses by retrieving relevant knowledge from external sources. Traditional retrieval methods return isolated text chunks, which can lead to incomplete answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we introduce Context-Enriched Retrieval, which ensures that retrieved information includes neighboring chunks for better coherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps in This Notebook:\n",
    "- Data Ingestion: Extract text from a PDF.\n",
    "- Chunking with Overlapping Context: Split text into overlapping chunks to preserve context.\n",
    "- Embedding Creation: Convert text chunks into numerical representations.\n",
    "- Context-Aware Retrieval: Retrieve relevant chunks along with their neighbors for better completeness.\n",
    "- Response Generation: Use a language model to generate responses based on retrieved context.\n",
    "- Evaluation: Assess the model's response accuracy."
